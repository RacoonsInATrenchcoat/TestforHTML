        H1: "Why are lizards objectively the best animal?"

    <p> <!-- Paragraph1, a block-level text, meaning it takes up the full width available and adds spacing above and below the text. -->
        Lizard is the common name used for all squamate reptiles other than snakes. <br>
        Lizards live in almost all contintents (except Antartica) and are hardy explorers. With their scaly skin, four
        legs and tails, they can be quite agile adventurers!<br>
    </p>

        H2: All about lizards!
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Main Characteristics</li>

        <ul> <!--List! <ol> is the main list entry, <li> are the items in it. -->
            <li>Habitat: Lizards inhabit a variety of environments, from deserts and forests to urban areas.</li>
            <li>Diet: Most lizards are carnivorous, feeding on insects, small animals, or eggs, though some species are
                herbivorous</li>
            <li>Age range: The average age depends heavily on the breed of the lizard. Geckos can live for 10/15 years, chameleons are 5/7 years.<br>
                Of course, this does not contain lizard wizards that have achieved immortality.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Secondary Characteristics
            <ul>
                <li>Movement: Some are able to run on water as they are just so <em>speedy!</em></li>
                <li>Escape: Some lizards are able to detach their tails but not all will regenerate them later.</li>
            </ul>
    </ol>
    <br> <!--<br> is linebreak, making the next line start anew. -->
    <p>
        This means that having lizards in your home is <strong>objectively</strong> a great idea, as it eats all the
        annoying bugs in your bedroom, allowing you to sleep well, knowing they guard your dreams.

    <h3>
        H3: Why lizards make the best wizards!
    </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1, Cold-Blooded Nature: Their ability to regulate body temperature based on their surroundings reflects a
            cool,
            calm demeanor, perfect for a wizard mastering the balance of elements.</li>
        <li>2, Regeneration: Been hit? Some lizards can regenerate their tails after losing them, symbolizing a wizard's
            ability to heal, restore, or reinvent themselves through magic.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>I mean look at this wizard, who is, a lizard:<br>
