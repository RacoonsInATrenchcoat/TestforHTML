                    Why are lizards objectively the best animal?
                </h1>
                <p>
                    Lizard is the common name used for all squamate reptiles other than snakes. <br>
                    Lizards live in almost all continents (except Antarctica) and are hardy explorers. With their scaly skin, four
                    legs, and tails, they can be quite agile adventurers!<br>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    All about lizards!
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Main Characteristics</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Habitat: Lizards inhabit a variety of environments, from deserts and forests to urban areas.</li>
                        <li>Diet: Most lizards are carnivorous, feeding on insects, small animals, or eggs, though some species are herbivorous.</li>
                        <li>Age range: The average age depends heavily on the breed of the lizard. Geckos can live for 10/15 years, chameleons are 5/7 years.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Secondary Characteristics</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Movement: Some are able to run on water as they are just so <em>speedy!</em></li>
                        <li>Escape: Some lizards can detach their tails, but not all will regenerate them later.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    This means that having lizards in your home is <strong>objectively</strong> a great idea, as they eat all the annoying bugs in your bedroom.
                </p>
                <h3>Why lizards make the best wizards!</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cold-Blooded Nature: Perfect for a wizard mastering the balance of elements.</li>
                    <li>Regeneration: Symbolizing a wizard's ability to heal and restore.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>I mean look at this wizard, who is, a lizard:<br>
