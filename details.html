                    Lizard is the common name used for all squamate reptiles other than snakes. <br>
                    Lizards live in almost all contintents (except Antartica) and are hardy explorers. With their scaly skin, four
                    legs and tails, they can be quite agile adventurers!<br>
                </p>
                <h2>
                    All about lizards!
                </h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Main Characteristics</li>
            
                    <ul> <!--List! <ol> is the main list entry, <li> are the items in it. -->
                        <li>Habitat: Lizards inhabit a variety of environments, from deserts and forests to urban areas.</li>
                        <li>Diet: Most lizards are carnivorous, feeding on insects, small animals, or eggs, though some species are
                            herbivorous</li>
                        <li>Age range: The average age depends heavily on the breed of the lizard. Geckos can live for 10/15 years, chameleons are 5/7 years.<br>
                            Of course, this does not contain lizard wizards that have achieved immortality.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Secondary Characteristics
                        <ul>
                            <li>Movement: Some are able to run on water as they are just so <em>speedy!</em></li>
                            <li>Escape: Some lizards are able to detach their tails but not all will regenerate them later.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
                <br> <!--<br> is linebreak, making the next line start anew. -->
                <p>
                    This means that having lizards in your home is <strong>objectively</strong> a great idea, as it eats all the
                    annoying bugs in your bedroom, allowing you to sleep well, knowing they guard your dreams.

                    H3: Why lizards make the best wizards!
                </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>1, Cold-Blooded Nature: Their ability to regulate body temperature based on their surroundings reflects a
                        cool,
                        calm demeanor, perfect for a wizard mastering the balance of elements.</li>
                    <li>2, Regeneration: Been hit? Some lizards can regenerate their tails after losing them, symbolizing a wizard's
                        ability to heal, restore, or reinvent themselves through magic.</li>
                </ul>
            
                <p>I mean look at this wizard, who is, a lizard:<br>
